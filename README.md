# Capstone Project – Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning

**Author:** Abiodun Samuel Akozo-Emiri  
**Program:** Full Stack Data Science Certification  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## 📘 Overview

This capstone project focuses on solving a real-world data challenge using end-to-end data science methodology — from data exploration to model building and evaluation. The goal was to extract insights, visualize trends, and build predictive models to guide decisions.

## 🧰 Project Features

- ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ✔ Data cleaning & preprocessing
- ✔ Visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- ✔ Correlation analysis
- ✔ Model building (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- ✔ Model evaluation (RMSE, R² Score)
